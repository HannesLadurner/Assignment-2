Data set 2

Validator used: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp
Validation results: Valid XML
Modification to create an invalid version:

1.A well-formed XML document must have a corresponding end tag for all of its start tags.
Action: Implementing a start tag without an end-tag <niederschlag>
Error: error on line 19894 at column 18: Opening and ending tag mismatch: niederschlag line 3 and datenrecherche
    
2.Nesting of elements within each other in an XML document must be proper.
Action: Swapping the order of the end-tag of <datenrecherche> and <messdaten>.
Error: error on line 19892 at column 20: Opening and ending tag mismatch: messdaten line 17683 and datenrecherche
    
3.Missing quotes in attributes, ambiguous meaning of special characters
Action: Deleting the " before the date character
Error: error on line 7 at column 21: AttValue: " or ' expected
    
    Note: We tried a lot of different validators, but they always just displayed the highest error, not all 3 at once. As an expample, on data set 2, the missing quotes is the highest error, thus displayed. But all implemented errors got detected just fine on their own.
